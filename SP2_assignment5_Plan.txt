


A platformer game where you can 

1.press a button to restart

all code should be able to be runnable again at the press of a button


2. have a timer and record time at the end

have a variable that stores current seconds and is displayed in top left
when the player wins the game displays the seconds in the center of the screen

3. have checkpoints

when player touches an orb it saves the last checkpoint as an integer, when the player hits an obstacle, a isHit is
changed to true, 3 if statements are run, in descending order, when the last checkpoint gets found, the position gets reset to that point   

4. 3 lives

a variable that goes down to 0 and starts at 3, everytime player hits an obstacle, the player loses a life

5.jumping

y=y-gravity+jumpvalue

when space is pressed jump value becomes double the gravity, after 1.25 seconds it reverses back to 0
6. obstacles

im going to use CORNERS as the rectangle mode for this to be easier


7. need to win 3 times, increasing difficulty each time


this will depend on whether im done with time to spare or not


















stage formula

if(xpos>=x1&&ypos>=y1&&xpos<=x2&&ypos>=y2+10){
gravity=0;
canJump2=true;
}else{
gravity=2;
}
